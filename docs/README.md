heyyy, let me give a small explanation of the details needed:

1. What the Intelligent Form Agent does?

       The form agent is designed to automatically read, understand, and analyze forms and documents, so humans donâ€™t have to manually dig through each file.
2. How to set up the environment?

       can you see a file named requirements.txt?, that has all the tools required to ececute the program.

       how to download all tools?
       just go to terminal create a virtual environment(if needed), then run the command ' pip freeze > requirements.txt '

       how to set api key for LLM you use?
       create a folder named ' .env ', create a variable named Groq_API_KEY= " paste your api key "
       I tell to name it the way i say, bc i have coded the name in ask_llm.py

3. How to run the agent? (step-by-step)

       can run in python terminal/ Jupyter notebook, in py terminal it has a manual work to type the file path, but in jupyter the ui is comparitvely smooth, I'll say both ways to run the agent

       after all set up i mentioned before, you are good to go

       1.Execution in py terminal
          
             1.open terminal, get into your venv(if you set one)
             2.run main.py file command is ' python main.py '
             //it is bit like a mvp, so it asks for number of files you want to upload, thus it loops that number of times to allow user to upload forms, you will be asked to enter file path manually, yes it has more manual work, jupyter nb solves this
             3.enter the exact file path of your form
             4.you can further test by asking question in terminal, expected output is the answer from llm.

        NOTE: right now i have made sure that the vector embeddings of the form content is deleted automatically, so there wont be history of previos data , which might give us wrong answers if not deleted in future form submissions.

        2.Execution in jupyter notebook

             1.The code main.ipynb inside notebooks folder has the entire code that can be run in jupyter notebook
             2.Before executing, make sure you choose the correct kernel which has all the tools installed
             3.that's it youare almost done, run all cells 
             4.in a cell you'll see upload button, upload files,
                  right now while uploading multiple files, you have to upload all files in one go, press cntrl + all files you want to upload in one go
             5.after clicking upload, click process in next cell, then go to next cell, type your query and boom, you can expect to dee the answer.

        NOTE: right now i have not worked to delete the vector embeddings of old forms, thus to expect accurate answers everytime, pls delete the vectorstore which will be created inside notebook folder everytime you attemot to process the forms you uploaded.

4. Example queries and expected output:

       All the forms are related to medical health , patients, any question related to data present in the form is expected to be answered, explore the contents in the form if possible.

       when running form b: query- who is the doctor involved?
                  ans- Dr. Priya Singh
       

5.  Optional: design notes or diagrams describing your pipeline/architecture.

       I have made a clear picture the pdf named Workfow.pdf, pls find the file attached.
